# Advent of Code

This is my [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) repository that I use to solve all the AoC challenges I come across. It is split up by year and day of the challenges. I use AoC to learn new skills, so this code should not be used for reference or learning purposes!

## New Day Setup

1. Make the right directory that you're interested in

2. Run the command: `cargo init --name aoc-<year>-<day>'
